**📄 Title**: InqEduAgent: A Personalized Multi-Agent Framework for Collaborative Learning Partner Recommendation  
**🎓 Conference**: AAAI 2025 (submitted)  
**✍️ Authors**: *[Anonymous for review]*

## 🔍 Overview

InqEduAgent is a multi-agent learning system designed to enhance **partner recommendation** in collaborative educational settings. By integrating **role modeling**, **co-learning interactions**, **Gaussian process regression**, and **Pareto-based optimization**, InqEduAgent identifies optimal peer matchings that improve learning accuracy and stability.

We propose two variants:
- **InqEduAgent-GP**: A global matching strategy leveraging Gaussian Processes.
- **InqEduAgent-LP**: A personalized strategy incorporating individual interaction histories for localized Pareto front construction.

## 📊 Highlights

- 🔬 Robust learning performance across **STEM**, **Humanities**, and **Social Sciences**.
- 🚀 State-of-the-art accuracy in both **average gain** and **individual best gain**.
- ⚖️ Superior **stability** and **generalizability** compared to non-strategic baselines.
- 🧠 Ablation results demonstrate the critical role of each system component.
